Part of my most recent challange: learn three languages at the same time c:




- UNDERSTANDING ASSEMBLY -> [taking notes in this repo wiki](https://github.com/RuiFilipeCampos/assembly_cosine/wiki)
- https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/24592.pdf


### Current state of the project

- calculates cosine (to a certain, improvable, precision)
- assembly code is linked to cpp
- the result is printed on screen

could end it right here, but I want to explore the language a bit more, in particular I want to use array stuff

### calling convention for double func(double) | x64 WIN

- arg register -> xmm0
- return register -> xmm0
